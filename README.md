## About The Project

SagaForge leverages the power of Mistral AI to generate dynamic, player-driven storylines in real-time. The backend is engineered for low-latency communication using Node.js, Socket.io, and Redis, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience for up to 8 concurrent players. The frontend is a modern and intuitive React application built with Material UI.

This project was built to explore the intersection of generative AI, real-time web technologies, and interactive entertainment.
